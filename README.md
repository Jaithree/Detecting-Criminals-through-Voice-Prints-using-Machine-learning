>Audio Classification Project
This project aims to classify audio signals using machine learning techniques. It includes feature extraction using librosa, data preprocessing with pandas and StandardScaler, and evaluation of classification models using accuracy and other metrics.

>Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates the following:
*Loading and preprocessing audio data.
*Feature extraction from .wav files using librosa.
*Model training and evaluation.
*Visualization of classification performance.

>Technologies and Libraries Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Librosa – Audio feature extraction
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Scikit-learn:
StandardScaler
train_test_split
accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
Google Colab integration via google.colab.drive

>How to Run
Clone the repository:
1.bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-classification.git
cd audio-classification
Install required packages:
2.bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the notebook:
3.bash
jupyter notebook Project.ipynb
Ensure your audio dataset is available at the correct path or mounted using Google Drive.

> Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report

>Results
The notebook displays visual insights into the model's performance using confusion matrices and statistical summaries.
